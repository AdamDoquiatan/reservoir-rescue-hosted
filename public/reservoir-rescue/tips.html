            <h3>#1: Turn off the tap while you brush your teeth</h3>
            <p>
                Did you know water gushes from the average faucet at 9.4 litres per second? That’s a lot of H2O swirling down your drain
                there. While you’re brushing your teeth with one hand, try turning off the faucet with the other. Save some
                of that good stuff for the rest of us!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>#2: Fix your leaky faucets</h3>
            <p>
                "What’s that dripping? Why it’s the sound of 19 litres of water being wasted every day because somebody didn’t fix a leaky
                faucet (not pointing any fingers). Seriously, people! Fix it yourself or hire a plumber. A racoon plumber!"
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>#3: Re-use your pasta liquid</h3>
            <p>
                "You know what plants crave? Exactly! That water you just cooked your pasta in – save it, let it cool, and water your plants
                with it. Just, uh, make sure it’s cooled off first. Like, cold. Otherwise, you can say goodbye to your begonias."
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>#4: Take shorter showers</h3>
            <p>
                "How long does it take to have a shower? I mean, what are you people doing in there!? Showers use up 15-19 litres of water
                per minute, so maybe do your daydreaming somewhere else."
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>#5: Don’t water your lawn</h3>
            <p>
                "Did you know that most lawns are overwatered? People are dumping as much as 340 litres per square foot per year on that
                thankless green patch in front of their houses. Just let it go brown! I mean what did that grass ever do
                for you?"
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>#6: Use less electricity</h3>
            <p>
                "You know what uses a lot of water? Power plants and hydro-electric dams! If you want to save water on the sly, using less
                electricity might just be the way to do it."
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>#7: Eat less meat</h3>
            <p>
                "It takes a whole lot of water to rear animals for meat, so maybe lay off the beef a little. The environment will thank you.
                The cows will thank you too!"
            </p>
